**The Tonal Spelling System of Mandarin Chinese**

---

## 1. Introduction

Mandarin Chinese is a tonal language, meaning the pitch or tone used to pronounce a syllable can change the meaning of a word. Traditional Pinyin uses diacritics to represent the four tones of Mandarin, but tonal spelling systems aim to reflect tones directly through the modification of vowel spellings. This paper explores a tonal spelling system that eliminates diacritics and instead uses consistent alterations to the vowel patterns to represent the first, second, third, and fourth tones.

This paper covers the foundational elements of this tonal spelling system, including the initial consonants (声母) and finals (韵母) with their associated tonal variants. Additionally, rules for syllable boundaries are discussed to ensure clarity in multisyllabic words.

## 2. Consonant System (声母表)

The tonal spelling system retains the same set of initials (consonants) found in standard Pinyin. These consonants are grouped by articulation type as follows:

| **Labials** | **Alveolars** | **Velars** | **Palatals** | **Retroflexes** | **Dentals** | **Sibilants** |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| b (玻)      | d (得)        | g (哥)     | j (基)       | zh (知)         | z (资)      | s (思)        |
| p (坡)      | t (特)        | k (科)     | q (欺)       | ch (蚩)         | c (雌)      |               |
| m (摸)      | n (讷)        | h (喝)     | x (希)       | sh (诗)         |             |               |
| f (佛)      | l (勒)        |            |              | r (日)          |             |               |

These consonants remain unchanged regardless of tone. The variation in tone is captured by modifying the finals (vowels and vowel combinations) rather than the initials.

## 3. Vowel System (韵母表) with Tonal Variations

In this tonal spelling system, the finals are altered to indicate the four tones of Mandarin. 

Below is a comprehensive table of finals with tonal variations, which demonstrate how vowel changes affect pronunciation:
| **Final (Base Form)** | **1st Tone** | **2nd Tone** | **3rd Tone** | **4th Tone** |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |

### Special Cases

For syllables such as 知 (zhī), 蚩 (chī), 诗 (shī), 日 (rī), 资 (zī), 雌 (cī), and 思 (sī), the final 'i' with its four tonal spelling forms are used.

## 4. Syllable Boundaries and Voiceless Consonant

When multiple syllables are written consecutively, their boundaries can sometimes be unclear, especially when the non-initial syllables begin with vowels. To avoid confusion, this system uses 'v' as a voiceless consonant.

### Example:

- **皮袄** (Pí ǎo): Written as "pirvau"

## 5. Conclusion

This tonal spelling system for Mandarin Chinese offers a consistent way to represent tones without diacritics. Compared to traditional Pinyin, it eliminates tone marks, making typing more efficient and reducing ambiguity. The modified vowel forms also aid pronunciation and comprehension.
